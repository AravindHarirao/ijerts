<h4>Publication Charges</h4>
<p>
    The International Journal of Engineering Research and Technology Science (IJERTS)) is an initiative to provide quality
    publishing platform for research scholars. All the papers are published after successful peer review by qualified researchers.

    We cover the costs partially through article processing fees. Our expenses are split among editorial costs, electronic composition and production,
    journal information system, manuscript management system, electronic archiving, overhead expenses, and administrative costs. Moreover, we are providing research paper publishing in minimum available cost.
